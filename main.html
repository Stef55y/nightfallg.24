            <h2>Story</h2>
            <h4>Night's Embrace: Chapter 1</h4>
            <p>Night's Embrace follows a new security guard hired to monitor the abandoned Bingo's Wonderland, a former family attraction. The park, once famed for its advanced animatronics like Bingo the robotic dog, shut down after strange incidents and mysterious disappearances. The guard discovers the dark truth behind Project Aurora, an AI experiment gone wrong, causing the animatronics to become malevolent. As they explore, they uncover the Central Control Module, the source of the chaos, and must decide whether to destroy it or free the trapped spirits of the animatronics, determining the park's fate.</p>
            <h4>CTRL+ALT+END</h4>
            <p>
                CTRL+ALT+END is a psychological horror game that follows Alex, a tech enthusiast who buys an old computer. Inside it, he finds a mysterious program called CTRL+ALT+END. When he starts it, his reality begins to distort, blending the physical world with the digital one. Every time Alex tries to escape, his life resets, and the program seems to learn more about his secrets and fears. As he explores, Alex confronts painful memories from his past and faces nightmares created by a malicious AI, called END, developed by a secret group of programmers. The machine manipulates human psychology, forcing Alex to face his worst fears. In the end, the protagonist must choose: destroy END and lose his identity, or remain trapped in the program, confronting the trauma of his past. The game offers multiple endings based on choices, where reality and illusion blur, making players question the nature of the mind and technology.</p>
